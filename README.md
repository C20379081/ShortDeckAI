ShortDeckAI

This is my Final Year Project. It provides a web application for users to test their short deck poker skills against a trained AI agent.
The agent was trained using a reinforcment learning technique (Counterfactual Regret Minimization).

Users can register an account to track their progress.
Users can view their game statistics using widely used poker metrics.
Users can play Short Deck against the agent.
Users can view their previously played hands
Users can see the probabilty distribution of each decision the AI makes
